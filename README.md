# Android Security Evolution

Significant security enhancements of recent major Android versions, starting with _Android 5.0 Lollipop_ (API 21).

## Android 5.0 (API 21) - Lollipop

[Security Enhancements in Android 5.0](https://source.android.com/docs/security/enhancements/enhancements50)

* Starting August 2023, _Google Play Services_ updates will only be received from this Android version see [Google Play services discontinuing updates for KitKat (API levels 19 & 20) starting August 2023](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/google-play-services-discontinuing-updates-for-kitkat.html)
* [Full Disk Encryption (FDE)](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/encryption/full-disk) by default (manufacturers can still opt out), see [Encryption](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/encryption) and [Security Enhancements in Android 5.0](https://source.android.com/docs/security/enhancements/enhancements50)
* [SELinux](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/selinux) fully enforced, see [Security Enhancements in Android 5.0](https://source.android.com/docs/security/enhancements/enhancements50)
* `WebView` is a separate package, see [Security Enhancements in Android 5.0](https://source.android.com/docs/security/enhancements/enhancements50) and [The Updatable WebView on Android 5.0 Lollipop What Is It and Why Should You Care?](https://infinum.com/blog/the-updateable-webview-on-android-5-lollipop-what-is-it-and-why-should-you-care/)

## Android 6 (API 23) - Marshmallow

[Security Enhancements in Android 6.0](https://source.android.com/docs/security/enhancements/enhancements60)

* [Keystore](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/security/KeyStore) API significantly extended (symmetric cryptographic primitives, _AES_ and _HMAC_ support and access control system for hardware-backed keys) see [Hardware-backed Keystore](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/keystore)
* [TEE](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/trusty) is a requirement, see [Hardware-backed Keystore](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/keystore) and [7.3.10. Fingerprint Sensor section of Android 6.0 Compatibility Definition](https://source.android.com/docs/compatibility/6.0/android-6.0-cdd#7_3_10_fingeprint)
* New API (`isInsideSecureHardware`) for checking whether a [KeyStore](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore) key is stored in _secure hardware_ (e.g., [Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/trusty) or Secure Element (SE)), see [isInsideSecureHardware method of KeyInfo](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyInfo#isInsideSecureHardware())
* Apps need to request permissions at runtime see [Runtime Permissions section of Android 6.0 Changes](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes#behavior-runtime-permissions) and [Request runtime permissions
](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting) and [Security Enhancements in Android 6.0](https://source.android.com/docs/security/enhancements/enhancements60)
* More restrictive [SELinux](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/selinux) (_IOCTL filtering_, tightening of _SELinux_ domains, etc.) see [Security-Enhanced Linux in Android](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/selinux) and [Security Enhancements in Android 6.0](https://source.android.com/docs/security/enhancements/enhancements60)

## Android 7 (API 24) - Nougat

[Security Enhancements in Android 7.0](https://source.android.com/docs/security/enhancements/enhancements70)

* Separate _User_ and _System Certificate Trust Store_, meaning _Man-in-the-Middle_ attacks basically require root access from this point, see [Changes to Trusted Certificate Authorities in Android Nougat](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/changes-to-trusted-certificate.html)
* Added [Network Security Config](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config) support so apps can customize the behavior of their secure (_HTTPS_, _TLS_) connections in a simple declarative way, without code modification. It supports custom trust anchors (which [Certificate Authorities (CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) the app trusts), debug-only overrides, _cleartext traffic_ opt-out and certificate pinning (limiting which server keys are trusted), see [Network Security Config section of Android 7.0 for Developers
](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/nougat/android-7.0#network_security_config)
* By default apps targeting _Android 7.0_ only trust system-provided certificates and no longer trust user-added [Certificate Authorities (CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority), even without custom [Network Security Config](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config), see [Default Trusted Certificate Authority of Android 7.0 for Developers](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/nougat/android-7.0#default_trusted_ca)
* Update to _Keymaster 2_ with support for [Key Attestation](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/keystore/attestation#key-attestation) and version binding (preventing rolling back to an unsecure old version without losing keys), see [Key Attestation section of Android 7.0 for Developers](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/nougat/android-7.0#key_attestation) and [Keymaster Functions](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/keystore/implementer-ref) and [Verifying hardware-backed key pairs with Key Attestation
](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-key-attestation) and [Key and ID Attestation
](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/keystore/attestation)
* [File Based Encryption (FBE)](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/encryption/file-based) introduced, but it's optional to implement by manufacturers, see [Direct Boot section of Android 7.0 for Developers](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/nougat/android-7.0#direct_boot) and [Support Direct Boot mode](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/direct-boot) and [Encryption](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/encryption)
* Updated [SELinux](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/selinux) configuration: further locking down application sandbox, breaking up mediaserver stack into smaller processes with reduced permissions (mitigation against Stagefright), see [Security-Enhanced Linux in Android](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/selinux)

## Android 8 (API 26) - Oreo

[Security Enhancements in Android 8.0](https://source.android.com/docs/security/enhancements/enhancements80)

* _JavaScript_ evaluation runs in a separate process in `WebView` so _JavaScript_ code cannot access the app's memory so easily, see [Whatâ€™s new in WebView security](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/06/whats-new-in-webview-security.html) and [Security section of Android 8.0 Behavior Changes for All Apps
](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0-changes#security-all)
* `WebView` respects [Network Security Config](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config) and `cleartextTrafficPermitted` flag (on older Android versions it loads _HTTP_ sites even if _clear text traffic_ should not be allowed by the config), see [Security section of Android 8.0 Behavior Changes for Apps Targeting Android 8.0](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0-changes#o-sec)
* [Safe Browsing API](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/webapps/managing-webview#safe-browsing) added to `WebView` so users would be warned when trying to navigating to a potentially unsafe website (verified by [Google Safe Browsing](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/)) if enabled, see [WebView APIs section of Android 8.0 Features and APIs](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0#wv)
* `FLAG_SECURE` `Window` flag is supported more and disallows taking screenshots of the screen where this is set
* Update to _Keymaster 3_ with rewritten [Hardware Abstraction Layers (HALs)](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/hal) written in _HAL Interface Definition Language (HIDL)_ and in C++ (as compared to [Legacy HAL](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/hal/archive) that was written in C) with [ID attestation](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/keystore/attestation#id-attestation) support, see [Hardware-backed Keystore](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/keystore) and [Keymaster Functions](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/keystore/implementer-ref) and [Key and ID Attestation
](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/keystore/attestation)
* _Project Treble_ introduced (only devices released with this version support project Treble, the ones updated will not get it), separating lower-level vendor code from Android system framework and enabling easier security update delivery, see [Here comes Treble: A modular base for Android](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html) and [Treble Plus One Equals Four](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/12/treble-plus-one-equals-four.html)
* Updated [SELinux](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/selinux) to work with _Treble_. _SELinux_ policy allows manufacturers and SOC vendors to update their parts of the policy independently from the platform and vice versa, see [Security-Enhanced Linux in Android](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/selinux)
* Further hardening media stack: mobild [Hardware Abstraction Layers (HALs)](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/hal) from running in a shared process to running in their own sandboxed processes
* To allow installing apps from unknown sources (i.e. not from _Google Play_) apps need explicit permission granted by the user for the particular app in Android settings (and users can revoke such permission and manage it per-app at any time too), see [User opt-in for unknown apps and sources section of Publish your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish#publishing-unknown) and [Security section of Android 8.0 Behavior Changes for All Apps](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0-changes#security-all)

## Android 9 (API 28) - Pie

[Android 9 release notes - Security features](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/about/p-release-notes#security_features)

* _Cleartext network traffic (HTTP)_ disabled by default, apps need to explicitly set `cleartextTrafficPermitted` to `true` in their [Network Security Config](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config) it if they still want to use it (not recommended), see [Network TLS enabled by default section of Behavior changes: apps targeting API level 28+
](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/android-9.0-changes-28#tls-enabled) and [Android: Cleartext HTTP traffic not permitted Android 9](https://nphausg.medium.com/android-8-cleartext-http-traffic-not-permitted-73c1c9e3b803)
* Update to _Keymaster 4_ with support for _3DES_ encryption and secure key import, see [Hardware-backed Keystore](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/keystore) and [Keymaster Functions](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/keystore/implementer-ref)
* Replace many _BouncyCastle_ implementations of cryptographic algorithms with _Conscrypt_ ones, see [Conscrypt implementations of parameters and algorithms section of Android 9 Behavior changes: all apps](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/android-9.0-changes-all#conscrypt_implementations_of_parameters_and_algorithms)
* Added support for embedded [Secure Element (SE)](https://source.android.com/docs/compatibility/cts/secure-element), see [Secure Element (SE) service section of Android 9 release notes
](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/about/p-release-notes#secure_element_se_service) and [CTS test for Secure Element](https://source.android.com/docs/compatibility/cts/secure-element)
* _Disk Encryption_ (can be either [Full Disk Encryption (FDE)](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/encryption/full-disk) or [File Based Encryption (FBE)](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/encryption/file-based)) is mandatory for all devices (shipping with this version)
* [BiometricPrompt](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt) introduced standardizing the UI that is shown during biometric authentication and providing a better API to apps that is harder to misuse, the previous solution, [FingerprintManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintManager) gets _deprecated_, see [Show a biometric authentication dialog](https://developer.android.com/training/sign-in/biometric-auth)
